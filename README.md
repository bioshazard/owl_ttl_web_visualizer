# OWL Web Visualizer

This project is a 3D web-based visualizer for ontologies (ttl files), built on top of the [3D Force-Directed Graph](https://github.com/vasturiano/3d-force-graph) library.

## Features

- **Direct Deployment:** Easily deploy the visualizer on your platform.
- **File Upload:** Use the "Load" button to upload your `.ttl` (Turtle) ontology files.
- **Interactive Exploration:** Navigate, search, and visualize the ontology with the implemented tools.
- **Node Expansion:** Click on nodes to expand them and reveal more connections within the ontology.
- **Node Deletion:** Remove nodes to declutter the visualization and focus on specific parts of the ontology.
